# Python Flask Template

A template set up to run Python Flask and deploy with Gunicorn.

## FAQ

- What is "**WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.**"?
  - This is a default warning when using Flask. It can be safely ignored in development and this Repl is configured to use a [Gunicorn](https://pypi.org/project/gunicorn/) [WSGI server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) in [production](https://docs.replit.com/category/deployments).
  - TL;DR: Don't worry about it. :)
